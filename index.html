        <p>
            Ghana, located along the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, is a vibrant country known for its rich history,
            diverse culture, and warm hospitality. It was the first African nation to gain independence from colonial
            rule in 1957 and has since remained a symbol of African freedom. The capital city, Accra, is a bustling hub
            of business, politics, and culture. Ghana is famous for its colorful festivals, traditional music, and
            delicious cuisine, including dishes like jollof rice and fufu. The country boasts beautiful landscapes, from
            serene beaches to lush forests and wildlife reserves. With over 100 ethnic groups, including the Akan,
            Mole-Dagbani, and Ewe, Ghana embraces unity in diversity and continues to play a key role in promoting peace
            and democracy in Africa.
